### Understanding the _command manual pages_

Reading through any command manual pages is pretty straight forward. 

On the terminal, try getting the manual for the `chmod` command: `man chmod`

The manuals section structure generally follows this order:

1. Command __name__ and __short description__
2. Command __synopsis__ or usage
3. Command __long description__
4. Command __options__ with option description
5. Usage __examples__

The more complex the commands, more complimentary sections are added in between.
