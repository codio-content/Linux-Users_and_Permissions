## User login names and password considerations

User names, also called _login names_, __let users access their own systems__ that have the appropriate access privileges such as the _read, write and execute_ modes we covered earlier in this section. 

You must choose a user name for each user account that you create.

### Establishing user names:

- Consider establishing a standard way of assigning user names so that they are easier for you to track. 
- Names should be easy for users to remember.

A simple scheme when selecting a user name is to use the first name initial and first seven letters of the user's last name.  For example, _John Doe_ becomes _jdoe_. 

Additionaly, you can add numbers to the _login names_ in case duplicates exist.

For _login names_ that relate to a specific role or funcionality, you can use names such as: _admin_, _sysadmin_.
