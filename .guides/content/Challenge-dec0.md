## Changing file permissions

So far, we've learned that the `ls -l` command option returns details for files and directories regarding its type, mode or permissions, size, modification time and name.

File modes may be updated with the `chmod` command which accepts the _mode_ definition by using the: `ugo`, letters for _user, group and others_ respectively. The operands `+-` determine whether to add or remove the _read, write or execute_ modes.
