## Establishing secure login passwords

You can specify a password for a user when you add the user. Or, you can force the user to specify a password when the user first logs in.

__Many breaches of computer security involve guessing a user's password.__

### Good choices for passwords include the following:

- Nonsense words made up of the first letters of every word in a phrase:
 eg., _hwwfcbtbl_ for _Hello World Was First Coined By Tim Berners Lee_.
- Words with numbers or symbols substituted for letters: 
 eg., _codio_ for _C0d3o_.
- A combination of both
  
### Do not use these choices for passwords:

- Your name (spelled forwards, backwards, or jumbled)
- Names of family members or pets
- Car license numbers
- Telephone numbers
- Words related to a hobby or interest
- Any word in the dictionary
