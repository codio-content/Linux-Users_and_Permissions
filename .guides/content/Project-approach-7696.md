## Resembling a CMS file structure

A Content Management System, or CMS for short, is a very popular kind of software that handles the creation, editing and presentation of content such as text, images, links, videos or documents.

Content Management Systems, as well as other kinds of software, include certain files and directories that need the proper permissions in order to: 

- Keep its content safe from any malicious access
- Allow the users to create, edit or delete content
- Allow the users to upload media
- Allow anyone with access to the network to read the content
- Allow only a certain group of users with access to the network to read the content
- Allow the software itself to write or execute certain files. eg. Settings files

The CLI, together with _bash_, provide commands that make managing file and directories permissions easy.
